# Gender Classification 

In this project we have implemented the CNN architecture of [this paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_workshops_2015/W08/papers/Levi_Age_and_Gender_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf) using IMDB-WIKI dataset 

### Dependencies Used

1. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org) : It is the Computer vision library which has C/C++, Python, Java interfaces. For this project, I have used OpenCV in Python.

2. [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/):TFlearn is a modular and transparent deep learning library built on top of Tensorflow. 


### Dataset used

[IMDB-WIKI â€“ 500k+ face images with age and gender labels](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/)
